[h1]Note[/h1]
[olist]
    [*] This text is generated by ChatGPT and has not been proofread.
    [*] I created this mod purely out of love for the characters. However, I don't have any rights to the images, so if the original illustrator raises objections, I will remove this mod.
    [*] Due to technical and copyright issues, this mod does not provide high-resolution versions. Users with 4K displays should consider this.
    [*] Since this mod serves as a personal training exercise, it may be rudimentary.

[h1]I'm very sorry, but due to personal time constraints, I can no longer maintain this project, which has ultimately led to its abandonment. I sincerely apologize to all users.[/h1]
